# DAOnation

## Introduction

**DAOnation:** DAOnation is a platform for charities to maximize their impact through decentralized innovation powered by the Polkadot SDK. Charities empower their mission with DAOs, personalized pages through AI, community goals, crypto-NFT events, and live-streaming charity events. It’s the best way to unlock the unparalleled value of decentralized giving!

## Features
1. **Integration of SubWallet with Polkadot SDK:** Enabling user-friendly login and seamless interactions with the Polkadot network, allowing users to manage digital assets, execute transactions, and interact with decentralized applications directly from their SubWallet interface.
2. **NFT Auction Events:** Organizing and managing NFT auction events where users can list their NFTs for bidding. This includes setting up auction parameters, tracking bids in real-time, and ensuring secure transfer of ownership once the auction concludes.
3. **Live Stream Events:** Hosting live stream events where participants can engage in real-time with content, interact with hosts or other participants, and potentially participate in live auctions or discussions.
4. **NFT Bidding and Transferring:** Facilitating the process of placing bids on NFTs, managing bid histories, and executing the secure transfer of NFT ownership upon successful bids. Smart contracts ensure trustless transactions between parties.
5. **Donation of NFTs to Events:** Allowing users to donate their NFTs as part of fundraising events or charity auctions. These NFTs can then be auctioned with proceeds going to the designated cause.
6. **Donation of Coins to Events:** Enabling the donation of cryptocurrencies to support events, charities, or specific causes. This includes setting up donation mechanisms, tracking contributions, and ensuring transparent distribution of funds.
7. **Web3 Ticket Purchase System:** Developing a Web3-based ticket purchase system where users can buy tickets for live-stream events using Polkadot SDK.
8. **DAO Homepage Generation with AI:** Utilizing AI to automatically generate a homepage for users to kickstart their community by integrating this with our website builder.
9. **Goals Generation with AI:** Implementing AI-driven tools to help communities define their goals and add relevant images.
